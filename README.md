# web_to_python_to_excel
This little project is a new approach to understanding the ETL process with Python. I scraped the Bookstoscrape website(E). Then I made a simple EDA(T) and inserted the data into an Excel file(L).
This approach is very useful in daily process. Imagine you have to delivery a report everyday, you can create something similiar using Python, and then create a batch file.
