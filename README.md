# web_to_python_to_excel
This little project is a new approach to understanding the ETL process with Python. I scraped the Bookstoscrape website(E). Then I made a simple EDA(T) and inserted the data into an Excel file(L).


This approach is useful in the daily process. Imagine you have to deliver a report every day. You can create something similar using Python. Then create a batch file.
